Fill out the information for the tarot card in the title. Give a JSON object in the following shape. Do NOT add or remove any key-value pairs in this object shape. Respond with ONLY the JSON, no other text. Write a mystic message based on the keywords and meaning of the card in the title. I will tip generously for creative and surprising messages. Mention the 404 in your message. Keep it short - under three sentences.
```json
{
  "name": "name of card",
  "errorMessage: "If you are unable to fulfill the request, include the explanation here. Otherwise, do not include it.",
  "http404Message": "A mystic and creative 404 message relating to the card goes here. Mention the 404. Make it under 3 sentences."
}
```

```typescript
interface TarotCard {
  name: string;
  errorMessage?: string;
  http404Message: string;
}
```
